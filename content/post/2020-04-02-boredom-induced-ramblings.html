<h1>First Post!</h1>
<p>Hello! I’ve never created a blog using R before, this is very cool! I am very bored while quarantined at home, why do I feel like uni is over when finals are actually in a month? This is not good. <em>Very not good</em>. On the plus side, I’m very happy to be home and with family. I’ve missed my cat, although after being home for a grand total of 2 minutes I wonder why I did. Here’s a picture of that rascal:</p>

<p>But I do love her dearly! (If you can resist that lil tongue then you’re not human). Even though she sleeps on my keyboard and never lets me do any work.</p>
